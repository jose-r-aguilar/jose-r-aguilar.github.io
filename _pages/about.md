Jose R. Aguilar Jr. is an enthusiastic and driven scholar-educator. He brings a wealth of experience and a solid commitment to addressing systemic issues in education. Born out of his personal experiences as a first-generation college student and a keen observer of the challenges faced by underrepresented communities, Jose has dedicated his career to dismantling the barriers that hinder the educational aspirations of Latino students.

Jose is a doctoral student and Computational Research for Equity in the Legal System (CRELS) Fellow in the Policy, Politics, and Leadership program at UC Berkeley’s School of Education. His research explores Latine post-secondary access, computational social science, big data, and artificial intelligence in education policy. Using computational methods, Jose investigates the factors influencing college readiness education policy-making and policies, access and equity for Latinx students, and students’ career pathways. As an emerging scholar in artificial intelligence and educational policy, he seeks to ensure that technological advancements equitably include the voices and needs of historically marginalized communities.

Jose’s teaching and research experience reflects his dedication to educational equity. As a Computer Science and Math Teacher at Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, he implemented culturally relevant pedagogy, differentiated instruction, and anti-racist socialization in mathematics to create inclusive learning environments. His leadership extended to developing rigorous math assessments and technology-enhanced activities.

His research portfolio includes a Russlynn Ali Fellowship at Education Trust West, where he examined math equity in California public schools, utilizing big data pipelines and identifying districts with exemplary outcomes for underserved populations. At Loyola Marymount University, he collaborated on a qualitative narrative study on the motivations of BIPOC women pursuing STEM in higher education. He also contributed as a Policy Research Fellow at The Campaign for College Opportunity, analyzing policies to improve access for low-income, underrepresented, and undocumented students. Additionally, Jose has provided critical policy insights to the Lumina Foundation and serves as a board member for ZETA, a nonprofit empowering Generation Z in technology and artificial intelligence

Jose’s academic journey includes an M.A. in Urban Education, Policy & Administration from Loyola Marymount University and dual bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science and Government, Mexican American & Latina/o Studies from The University of Texas at Austin. He dedicates his work to his former students and remains committed to improving post-secondary education to fulfill his promise of change.
